We are a research group in the [Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/) within the [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/) at the [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/). We are also part of the [ETH AI center](https://ai.ethz.ch/), the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/), the [Ellis Society](https://ellis.eu/) and the [ETH Zurich - EPFL Joint Doctoral Program in the Learning Sciences](https://lse.ethz.ch/doctoral-program-in-learning-sciences.html).

Our research spans natural language processing, deep learning, and knowledge representation and reasoning. We also work on problems in the intersection of NLP and Education. Our current focus areas include:
1. Reasoning in natural language, particularly neuro-symbolic approaches and causality
2. Processing of long documents and contexts
3. Human-centered NLP in educational contexts

We are located in the [beautiful](https://www.zuerich.com/en) city of Zurich in Switzerland. We regularly exchange ideas and work with our neighbors in [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io/) and the [Zurich-NLP group](https://zurich-nlp.ch/), as well as with our colleagues in the [Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/).

We are grateful for funding from [SNF](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx), [ETH Research Grants](https://ethz.ch/en/research/research-promotion/eth-grants.html), [Haslerstiftung](https://haslerstiftung.ch/), the [ETH AI center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) and the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/).
